= SpringFox Starter

This project provides a starter for using http://springfox.github.io/springfox/[SpringFox] in your project.
SpringFox is a project that aims at creating automated JSON API documentation for APIâ€™s built with Spring and
is used to integrate Swagger into an application.

You can read the SpringFox documentation http://springfox.github.io/springfox/docs/current[here]

This starter is a opinionated library that has 2 main purposes:

. Generates a simple swagger project using SpringFox but without creating/using the SpringFox beans/annotations
(*Docket*, *EnableSwagger2*, etc).

. Excludes from security all swagger endpoints and paths... if your app has security.

== Try it

You only need to add to your *pom.xml* this dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.springfox.starter</groupId>
    <artifactId>springfox-starter</artifactId>
    <version></version>
</dependency>
----

Use the last version in tag *<version>*

== Configure it

You can customize some parameters to conform the generated swagger.

By default, the starter search all your endpoints in under */api/* but you can change this with the
*swagger.paths* property:

[source,properties]
.application.properties
----
swagger.paths=/api/v4/.*
----

Also you can customize visual swagger parameters like title, description, version and license:

[source,properties]
.application.properties
----
swagger.title=The TITLE
swagger.description=The DESC
swagger.version=2.2
swagger.license=Another license
----

== Test it

Assuming you are working on a local environment, you can view the generated swagger endpoint here (this is the
default Swagger UI endppoint):

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
